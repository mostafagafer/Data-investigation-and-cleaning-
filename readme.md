#Introduction
in this code I studied the different factors on different countries from 1960 to 2015. the data I used is:
1- total GDP inflation adjuted, which I beleive could act as a final representation of wealth.
2- Suicide per 100000 population, which I beleive could act as a final representation of sadness and depression
3- Population density per square KM, which I wanted to study if the crowded countries correlate with GDP
4- life expectancy in years, which I thought is a final represetation of general well being
.

##I planned to study the following:
1- Is there a correlation between the increase in GDP with the increase in the country population
2- Is there a correlation between the increase in country population or with general well being
2- Is there a correlation between the suicide rate with the increase in the GDP

#Conclusions
GDP VS population density: my observation were as follow:
1- increasing in GDP is always associated with increase in population per square Km.
2- when comparing the results of Egypt and Sweden, I noticed that when Egypt population increased from 30 to 90 resulted in an increase in GPD with 2.5 while incase of Sweden, an increase in population of 8 per square Km resulted in increase in GDP up to 5.
3- Any flat curve in population might reflect in decrase in GDP in the following years as shown in Grenada and Sweden.
4- Low pupulation per square Km countries dosn't always have low GDP and vise versa

#Populationdensity VS life expectancy: my observation were as follow:
low GDP countries suffer from low life expectancy

#GDP Vs sucide rate: my observation were as follow:
no correlation observed

#Limitation
1- too many nan values, and I couldn't fill them with mean as they may change the data.
2- in the cleaning process, many countries (such as China) were lost.
3- could be much better to obtain the slope and intercept of the regression equation of the GDP curve.
